Changes in v1.6.1

-Removed dependency on the Tomcat libs: The project can now be built without a Tomcat installation

Changes in v1.6.0

-All Lucene-related classes have been upgraded to Lucene v3.0.2. Major changes include:
--Search results are now returned in a new ResultDocList Object instead of a ResultDoc[]
  array. This provides for more efficient searching (does not require an additional
  loop over results as before) and expandability (methods can be added to the ResultDocList
  to support future fuctnionality) and better utilizes the built-in Lucene classes
  for search than before (TopDocs, Sort, etc.)
--Uses Lucene Sort class for sorting at search time. Replaces logic that sorted
  results after the search (deprecated but still supported for backward-compatibility)

- Final previous version was tagged in CVS with 'lucene_2_4_final_version'
