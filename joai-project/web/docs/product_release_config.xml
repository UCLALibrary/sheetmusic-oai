			<![CDATA[ 
			jOAI is a Java-based open source <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/" target="_blank">Open Archives Initiative</a> 
			data provider and harvester tool that runs in a 
			servlet container such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Tomcat</a>. 
			
			<br/><br/>
			
			<a href="http://www.dlese.org/oai/docs/provider.jsp">The jOAI data provider</a> allows XML files from a file system to be 
			exposed as items in an OAI data repository and made available for harvesting by others using the OAI-PMH. After 
			pointing the software to one or more file directories, the software monitors the XML files inside, adding, 
			updating or deleting them from the OAI repository as files are added, updated or deleted from the directories. 
			
			<br/><br/>
			
			<a href="http://www.dlese.org/oai/docs/harvester.jsp">The jOAI harvester</a> is used to retrieve metadata records 
			from remote OAI data providers and save them to the local file system, one record per file. In addition, 
			records that have been harvested are packaged into zip archives that can be downloaded and opened through 
			the harvester's web-based interface.
			
			<br/><br/>
			
			This software is developed by Digital Learning Sciences (DLS) (<a href="http://www.dlsciences.org/">http://www.dlsciences.org/</a>)
			at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (<a href="http://www.ucar.edu/">http://www.ucar.edu/</a>). jOAI can be installed on Windows, Linux, Mac OS or UNIX systems.
